# Members-only clubhouse

This is an 'Odin Project exercise'.

To try it, this is the HEROKU link (it might take some time to lead) => https://members-only-club.herokuapp.com/

Instructions can be found on this website :
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav

The purpose is to practice the chapter about authentication :

I had to implement the log-in and authentication system by hand,
using Session management, Cookies, Remember Token and helpful methods to manage the current user checks.

The trick then was to make sure that only signed in users can see the author of each post.
If not signed in, they can only see the post contents.

It was also my first time to try and play around with Bootstrap.
