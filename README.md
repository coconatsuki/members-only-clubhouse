This is an 'Odin Project exercise'.

Instructions can be found on this website :
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav

The purpose is to practice the chapter about authentication :

The trick then was to make sure that only signed in users can see the author of each post.
If not signed in, they can only see the post contents.
